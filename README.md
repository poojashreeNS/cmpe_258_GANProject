# cmpe_258_GANProject

For part A colab: 
- Use the cell named prediction.
- Send the folder name to the function mask_prediction.
- if prediction is 0 then the face in the image contains mask, else if it is 1 then it doesn't contain mask.
- For now I have just added print statement and the image location for target 0 and 1, which can then be replaced by GAN for 0 and Classification model for 1.
